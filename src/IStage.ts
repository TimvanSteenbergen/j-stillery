     * This method will be executed by the pipeline when the stage should "run". The input parameter can be modified
     * during the execution of the invoke method. When all actions of this stage are complete the stage should call
     * the "resolve" callback with the desired output. This will hand back control to the pipeline which will further
     * handle the output.
     *
     * This method SHOULD always call "next" callback somewhere in it's body to trigger the pipeline to execute the
     * next stage. This method SHOULD only resolve after the next stage resolves.
     *
     * If an error occurs during the execution of this method, the "reject" callback SHOULD be called with the reason
     * for the failure. This will then be returned to the user by the pipeline.

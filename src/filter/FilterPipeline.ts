 * Filter pipeline
 *
 * The filter pipeline is a "sub-pipeline" which can run as part of a filter stage in the "main" pipeline. Stages
 * can be piped onto the filter pipeline and when the pipeline run's it will hand control back to the "main" pipeline
 * once it completes its "up" process. When the next stage in the "main" pipeline resolves, this "sub-pipeline" will
 * resume with its "down" process.

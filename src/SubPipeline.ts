/**
 * Sub pipeline
 *
 * The "sub-pipeline"" is a pipeline which can run as part of a stage (e.g. the filter stage) in the "main" pipeline.
 * Stages can be piped onto the sub pipeline and when the pipeline run's it will hand control back to the "main"
 * pipeline once it completes its "up" process. When the next stage in the "main" pipeline resolves, this
 * "sub-pipeline" will resume with its "down" process.
 *
 * If the next stage of the main (parent) pipeline is not set before the pipeline has completed it's "up" process, the
 * pipeline will resolve the "up" process like any other and immediatly continue with its down process.

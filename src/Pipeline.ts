/**
 * Pipeline
 *
 * Pipeline class containing stages which will be executed in sequence. Stages need to implement the IStage interface
 * and are responsible for calling the "next" method of the pipeline to advance to the next stage. When a stage is
 * either resolved or rejected control is given back to the class that called next on the pipeline, triggering the
 * stage execution. When the first stage in the pipeline is resolved (it resolves last since it will wait for all other
 * stages in the pipeline to resolve first) the pipeline is resolved with the output from the first stage. Stages can
 * therefore modify output before and after the "next" call.
